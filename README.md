# 30 Days of Machine Learning â€“ Foundations

Welcome to my **30 Days of ML Foundations journey**!  

This repo will track my daily learning â€” focusing only on **Python, Pandas, Visualization, Math, and Core ML concepts**.  
Each day Iâ€™ll learn one concept, implement it in code, and push it here.
